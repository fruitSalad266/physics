# Physics
A simple physics engine that I made with c++.
Currently working on constraint solver. 

TODO:
- Ability to simulate springs
- Double pendulum simulation
- Aiming for *O(n log n)* calculation of collisions
    - This requires spatial partitioning

Using Vertlet integration for smooth support
